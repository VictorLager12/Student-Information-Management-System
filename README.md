# Student Information Management System (SIMS) - Phase I

## Project Description

This project focuses on the development of a Student Information Management System (SIMS) using PL/SQL with an Oracle database. The primary goal of Phase I is to lay the foundation for a system designed to streamline and automate critical academic operations within universities, addressing the challenges associated with manual data management. This phase covers the initial design, definition of core entities, and outlining the system's architecture and anticipated benefits.

## Problem Definition

### Issue
Universities often rely on manual processes for managing essential student data, course enrollments, and academic records. These processes are often:
* ‚è≥ **Time-consuming**
* ‚ùå **Error-prone**
* üìâ **Inefficient**
* Resulting in delays, inaccuracies, and redundant data entries.

### Impact
Manual data management leads to significant negative consequences:
* üìä **Poor data quality**
* ‚ôªÔ∏è **Duplication of efforts**
* üí∏ **Ineffective resource allocation**
* üöß **Hindered overall efficiency** of academic operations

## Context

* **Where:** The SIMS is intended for implementation within university settings to manage student-related academic operations.
* **How:** The system aims to automate key workflows, including student enrollment, grade calculation, timetable generation, and transcript management. It will serve as a centralized platform for students, lecturers, and administrators to access and manage academic information.

## Target Users

* **Students:** Will use the system to enroll in courses, view their grades, and access academic timetables.
* **Lecturers:** Will utilize the system for managing courses, assessing student performance, and tracking academic progress.
* **Administrators:** Will oversee academic operations, generate necessary reports, and ensure compliance with university regulations.

## Phase I Project Goals

* **Automate Workflows:** Begin streamlining processes like enrollment, grade tracking, and timetable generation.
* **Improve Accuracy:** Lay the groundwork to minimize errors in student data and academic records.
* **Enhance Data Security:** Define mechanisms for secure storage and management of sensitive student information.
* **Reduce Data Duplication:** Establish a structure to eliminate redundant data entries and ensure a single source of truth.
* **Provide Real-Time Access:** Design the system to enable students, lecturers, and administrators to access up-to-date information.

## Core Entities and Relationships (Phase I Design)

The SIMS architecture is built upon several interconnected core entities:

* **Students:** Enrolled individuals belonging to Departments, taking Courses via Enrollments, and making Payments.
* **Lecturers:** Academic staff belonging to Departments and teaching Courses.
* **Courses:** Subjects offered by Departments, taught by Lecturers, and enrolled by Students. Assessed via Grades.
* **Departments:** Academic units housing Students, Lecturers, and Courses.
* **Enrollments:** Link Students to specific Courses.
* **Grades:** Track student performance in Courses (including assignment, exam, and attendance scores).
* **Payments:** Records of tuition fees and other financial transactions made by Students.

These entities are linked through defined relationships to ensure data integrity and support efficient data querying.

## Anticipated Benefits 

The SIMS aims to offer a range of benefits by reducing manual effort and minimizing errors:

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Efficiency:** Streamlines academic operations and reduces manual effort.
* ‚úÖ **Accuracy:** Minimizes errors in student data and academic records.
* üîç **Transparency:** Provides clear and accessible information to students and lecturers.
* üìà **Scalability:** Supports growing numbers of students and courses.
* üîí **Data Security:** Ensures secure storage and management of sensitive student and academic data, reducing the risk of data breaches.

# Phase II: Business Process Modeling (Management Information Systems - MIS)

## Objective

The primary goal of this phase is to model a business process relevant to Management Information Systems (MIS). This involves visualizing how information flows within the target system, detailing the interactions between different entities (actors, departments, systems), and illustrating how the MIS supports decision-making throughout the process. The specific process modeled is related to student course enrollment and subsequent fee processing within an academic institution's MIS.

---

## Tasks and Deliverables

### 1. Define the Scope

* **Business Process Modeled:**
    * The diagrams model the **Student Course Enrollment and Fee Payment Process**. It starts with the initiation of course enrollment and covers eligibility checks, course selection, validation, record updates, fee calculation, payment processing, and status updates, including handling unsuccessful paths or errors.
    * This process is highly relevant to MIS as it involves managing core student academic and financial data, automating workflows, ensuring data integrity across different modules (e.g., registration, finance), and providing status information to stakeholders (students, administrators).

* **Process Relevance to MIS:**
    * The process relies on an MIS (Student Information System - SIMS) to:
        * Check student eligibility based on existing records.
        * Validate course selections against prerequisites and available quotas.
        * Update student enrollment records and potentially generate timetables.
        * Calculate tuition fees based on enrollment.
        * Track payment status.
        * Manage student academic/financial holds.
        * Provide notifications and display status/error messages.

* **Objectives and Expected Outcomes:**
    * **Objectives:** To efficiently and accurately process student course enrollments, validate eligibility and course selections, update academic records, calculate and process tuition fees, and manage student enrollment status.
    * **Expected Outcomes:**
        * Successful enrollment of eligible students in selected courses.
        * Accurate and updated student academic records (enrollments, timetables).
        * Correct calculation and notification of tuition fees.
        * Efficient processing of student payments.
        * Clear communication of enrollment status, errors, or holds to students.
        * Reduced manual effort and errors compared to non-MIS processes.


### 2. Identify Key Entities

## Key Entities

| Entity | Role | BPMN Mapping |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Student** | Initiates registration, takes exams | "Student Examined (Support)/Hands" |
| **Academic Hub** | Validates skills mastery | "Headup Course Examination" |
| **Finance System** | Processes certification fees | "Follow Foss Payment" path |
| **Notification Service** | Alerts on deadlines/results | "Notify Blower of Foss Due" |

### 4. Apply BPMN Notations and ensure a Logical Flow

# Phase III: Database Schema Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document details the conceptual database schema for the Student Information Management System (SIMS). The goal of this schema is to provide a structured, reliable, and efficient foundation for managing student-related academic and administrative data, thereby streamlining university operations as outlined in the system's objectives. This schema defines the core entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them, ensuring data integrity and supporting the various functionalities of the SIMS.



## 2. Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:
![er model](<PhaseI to VII screenshots/phase_III.png>)


## 3. Core Entities and Relationships

The database schema is composed of the following key entities, representing the main components of the university's academic structure:

* **`STUDENT`**
    * **Purpose:** Represents individual students enrolled in the university.
    * **Attributes:** `student_id` (PK - Unique Identifier), `first_name`, `last_name`, `sex`, `date_of_birth`, `email`, `phone`, `address`.
    * **Links:** Belongs to one `DEPARTMENT` (via `dept_number` FK).

* **`DEPARTMENT`**
    * **Purpose:** Represents academic departments within the university.
    * **Attributes:** `dept_number` (PK - Unique Identifier), `dname` (Department Name), `campus`.
    * **Links:** Headed by one `LECTURER` (via `HOD_ID` FK), associated with multiple `STUDENT`s, `LECTURER`s, and `COURSE`s.

* **`COURSE`**
    * **Purpose:** Represents academic courses offered by departments.
    * **Attributes:** `course_code` (PK - Unique Identifier), `title`, `credit`, `description`.
    * **Links:** Offered by one `DEPARTMENT` (via `dept_number` FK), can be taught by `LECTURER`s, and enrolled in by `STUDENT`s (via `ENROLLMENT`).

* **`LECTURER`**
    * **Purpose:** Represents academic staff responsible for teaching courses.
    * **Attributes:** `lecturer_id` (PK - Unique Identifier), `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `salary`.
    * **Links:** Assigned to many `DEPARTMENT` (via `dept_number` FK), can teach multiple `COURSE`s. One lecturer can be assigned as Head of Department (`HOD_ID` in `DEPARTMENT`).

* **`ENROLLMENT`**
    * **Purpose:** Represents the registration of a specific `STUDENT` in a specific `COURSE` for a given period. This acts as a linking table between `STUDENT` and `COURSE`.
    * **Attributes:** `enrollment_code` (PK - Unique Identifier), `enrollment_date`, `status`.
    * **Links:** Connects one `STUDENT` (via `student_id` FK) to many `COURSEs` (via `course_code` FK). Each enrollment results in one `GRADE` record.

* **`GRADE`**
    * **Purpose:** Records the academic performance assessment for a student's enrollment in a course.
    * **Attributes:** `grade_code` (PK - Unique Identifier), `assignment_score`, `exam_score`, `attendance_score`, `final_grade`.
    * **Links:** Directly associated with  `ENROLLMENT` record (via `enrollment_code` FK).

* **`PAYMENT`**
    * **Purpose:** Tracks financial transactions made by students for tuition or other fees.
    * **Attributes:** `payment_code` (PK - Unique Identifier), `amount`, `payment_date`, `method`, `transaction_id`.
    * **Links:** Associated with one `STUDENT` (via `student_id` FK).

## 2. Task Requirements:

**Problem Description:**
The university administration wants to understand how students are performing academically within each department. Specifically, they need a report that ranks students within their respective departments based on their average final grade. This will help identify top-performing students in each academic area and potentially students who might need additional support. university administration also want to know course popularity among students such that they can know courses that interests students more than others.

**Window functions analysis**

# Phase VII: Advanced Database Programming and Auditing

## 1. Problem Statement Development
The Student Information Management System (SIMS) requires strict controls over data modifications to prevent unauthorized or untimely changes that could compromise data integrity, disrupt academic operations, or violate compliance policies. Currently, there is no automated mechanism to enforce "data modification blackout periods"‚Äîrestricting DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on core tables during weekdays (Monday‚ÄìFriday) and upcoming public holidays. Additionally, the system lacks a comprehensive audit trail for tracking DML attempts, whether successful or blocked.

Justification for Advanced Database Features
**Triggers**

**Necessity**: To automatically intercept and validate DML operations before execution, enforcing time-based restrictions without relying on application-level checks.

**Value**: Ensures consistent, real-time enforcement of business rules (e.g., blocking changes on holidays/weekdays) directly at the database level.

**Packages**

**Necessity**: Complex logic (e.g., holiday lookups, rule validations) requires modular, reusable code.

**Value**: Encapsulates related procedures/functions (e.g., checking blackout periods, logging attempts) for cleaner triggers and easier maintenance.

**Auditing**

**Necessity**: Compliance and security demand tracking all DML attempts (allowed/denied).

**Value**: Provides an audit trail for accountability, security reviews, and troubleshooting by logging user actions, timestamps, and operation outcomes.

**Conclusion**
Using triggers, packages, and auditing ensures automated, secure, and compliant data management in SIMS, addressing critical gaps in access control and accountability.

## 2. Trigger Implementation



```SQL

    -- Returns TRUE if DML is allowed, FALSE otherwise.

    EXCEPTION
